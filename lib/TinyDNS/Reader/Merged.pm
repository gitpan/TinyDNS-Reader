=head1 NAME

TinyDNS::Reader::Merged - Read a TinyDNS file and merge records.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<TinyDNS::Reader> module will allow you to parse a TinyDNS zonefile,
into a number of distinct records, one for each line.

However there is no handling the case where you'd expect a single DNS
value to have multiple values.

For example if you were to parse this file you would get two records:

=for example begin

     db.example.com:1.2.3.4:300
     db.example.com:10.20.30.40:300

=for example end

On a purely record-by-record basis that is as-expected, however when you
actually come to manipulate your DNS records you'd expect to have a single
logical object with values something like this:

=for example begin

     {
       'ttl' => '300',
       'value' => [
                    '1.2.3.4',
                    '10.20.30.40'
                  ],
       'name' => 'db.example.com',
       'type' => 'A'
     },

=for example end

This module takes care of that for you, by merging records which consist
of identical "name" + "type" pairs.

Use it as a drop-in replacing for L<TinyDNS::Reader>.

Constructor.

This module expects to be given a C<file> parameter, pointing to a
file which can be parsed, or a C<text> parameter containing the text of the
records to parse.

=begin doc

Parse the records and return a merged set.

The parsing is delegated to L<TinyDNS::Reader>, so all supported record-types
work as expected.
